==Understanding how stuff works (or doesn't)==
</div>
<div class="mw-collapsible-content">
A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyHy3uFJrj0 Restarters' Training Session] makes an easy introduction to the following sections down to and including Electronic Components. It consists of a presentation with audio commentary, lasting around 50 minutes.
* [[Electric circuits, volts amps watts and ohms]] - what every Restarter should know.
* [[AC and DC]] - what's the deal?
* Electronic components - recognition, failure modes and testing:
** [[Basic electronic components]] - Resistors, capacitors, inductors and transformers, and quartz crystals.
** [[Active components]] - Diodes and rectifiers, transistors, and integrated circuits (ICs).
** [[Passive components]] - Switches, push-buttons and connectors.
** [[Protection components]] - Various devices for over-voltage and over-current protection. Fuses are only the beginning!
* [[Batteries]] - different types, shapes and sizes, what they're good for, how to buy them, use them and dispose of them.
* [[Light bulbs]] - the several different types and their various shapes, sizes and bases, all explained.
* [[Electric motors]] - different types, how to recognise them, test them and maybe fix them.
* [[Power supplies]] - how they work, what can go wrong, and how to test and fix them.
* [[How radios work]] - basic theory to help you understand what might be wrong when you can't see it with your own eyes.
* [[All about SSDs]] - everything you always wanted to know but were afraid to ask.

[http://www.learnabout-electronics.org/ Learn About Electronics] is an excellent site if you'd like a different view of the basics, or if you'd like to go deeper.
